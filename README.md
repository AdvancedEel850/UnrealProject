# UnrealProject

# Overview

Im in the process of building an environment in the Unreal Engine editor. This involves sculpting the landscape, painting foliage, and more. My personal favorite part was the sculpting, as you can be as free as you want with it.

I want to go into game development, and getting a good foundation in a game editor such as Unreal Engine is great.

# Development Environment

I used Unreal Engine and many youtube tutorials for the project.

I mostly used the blueprints in Unreal engine. The is a way to use C++ in Unreal Engine as well.
